Add lemon juice, if desired, and quickly pulse to combine.Allrecipes VideoFrequently Asked QuestionsWhat pasta is best for pesto?Any pasta with some texture will work well because the ridges, dimples, or holes in various pasta styles will capture the sauce and help coat the noodles. Spiral noodles like fusilli or rotini are great as well as penne with ridges, bowtie, or bucatini.Is pesto served hot or cold?The short answer is both. Depending on the recipe, pasta can be served cold, like on a sandwich or hot with pasta or in lasagna. What really matters is the temperature of the dish you are serving. Warm or chill your pesto depending on the recipe.What else can pesto be made from?If you don't have any basil but need to whip together a pesto, consider using parsley, cilantro, broccoli or broccolini, arugula, dandelion greens, or scallions. These are great examples of other greens to use for pesto, but the flavor will vary as a result. You are trying to achieve that bright, herby flavor that pesto is loved for. If you don't have Parmesan cheese on hand, consider using other hard cheeses like Pecorino, or if pine nuts aren't an option, toasted walnuts or pistachios are a great solution.How do you thin or thicken pesto sauce?A little water, chicken stock, or white wine will help thin out pesto, and if you want to thicken pesto, a cornstarch slurry will do just that. You can also use a roux made from flour and olive oil as well as pasta water or a lot more basil leaves.""]",4.7,Unknown,"['olive oil', 'pine nuts', 'lemon juice']",5 mins,N/A,5 mins,16,92.0,9,1,2
